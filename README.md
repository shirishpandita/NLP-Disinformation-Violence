# NLP-Based Motion Analysis on Violent Offenders Dataset

This repository contains the core code and supporting data from my Master's dissertation titled:

**"Analysis of Social Media Posts Related to Gun Violence and Terrorism Using Artificial Intelligence: An Analysis-Based Study."**

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze digital behavioral cues using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in relation to social media discourse around terrorism, gun violence, and public sentiment. The study emphasizes the identification of potential motion cues (linguistic and temporal) from textual content related to violent incidents and offenders.
